# Download Forcing

Here it is explained how to download the used forcing data.

The forcing of HBV + D-RR and Wflow_sbm consists of:
* Potential Evaporation KNMI
* Precipitation NRR
* Temperature ERA5-Land

The precipitation analysis consists of:
* Precipitation KNMI
* Precipitation NRR
* Precipitation SPW

The potential evaporation analysis consists of:
* Potential Evaporation ERA5-Land
* Potential Evaporation KNMI

The determination of S$_{u,max}$ is done by:
* Precipitation NRR
* Total Evaporation ERA5-Land
