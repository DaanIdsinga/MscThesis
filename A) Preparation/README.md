# A) Preparation

This section contains the preparation phase of the research. This consists of:

1) Determine Areas: How large are the subsubcatchments and the paved and unpaved areas?
2) New Paved Areas: How to add the necessary extra paved areas to D-RR?
3) Forcing: Which forcing is used and why?
4) Forcing Analysis: Which forcing is used for HBV?
5) Setup hydrological models
5.1) Update Wflow_sbm laterals
5.2) HBV calibration
