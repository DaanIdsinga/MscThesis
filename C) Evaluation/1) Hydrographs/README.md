# 1) Hydrographs

This section contains the Notebooks to plot the hydrographs of the D-HYDRO simulations. Before running the Notebook, you have to create CSV files containing the discharge at the measurement locations in the model. A Royal HaskoningDHV intern script is used for this and cannot be published here.
