# C) Evaluation

This section contains the evualation of the D-HYDRO runs. The impact of a land cover change can be evaluated by the hydrographs and the flood exents.

1) Hydrographs: Notebook to create the hydrographs at the measurement locations and compare the hydrological models;
2) Flood extents: QGIS steps to estimate the total area and the area per land cover class of the flood extent.
