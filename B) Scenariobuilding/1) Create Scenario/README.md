# 1) Create Scenario

The scenariobuilding process starts by a scenario idea. You need to know the area of the new houses and their location(s). The new area is added as paved area, so you need to know the total paved area. The land cover map contains the category <I>Discontinuous Urban Fabric</I>. This category consists of 70% paved area and 30% unpaved area. Keep this in mind by constructing the scenarios. 
In the research, the 70% is applied to the increase in paved areas for HBV. So, for example scenario 1a, where 6 km^2 paved area is added, resulted in 6 km^2 <I>Discontinuous Urban Fabric</I> and 4.2 km^2 Paved area in HBV.
