B) Scenariobuilding

This section contains the process to create and execute a scenario of a change in land cover. The process consists of 8 steps:

1) Create Scenario: The process starts by knowing what change you want to simulate;
2) Update Land Cover: Translate the scenario into a changed land cover map;
3) Update HBV & D-RR: Update the unpaved and paved areas of HBV and D-RR;
4) Update Wflow_sbm: Update the land cover parameters in the Wflow_sbm parameterset;
5) Run HBV: Run HBV for the unpaved areas;
6) Run Wflow_sbm: Run Wflow_sbm;
7) Couple laterals: Translate the output of the hydrological models to input for D-HYDRO;
8) Run D-HYDRO: Execute the scenario by simulating in D-HYDRO.
